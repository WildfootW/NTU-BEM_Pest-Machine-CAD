[How to Make a Flexible Subassembly with Top-Down Design Method in SOLIDWORKS?](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/44920/how-to-make-a-flexible-subassembly-with-top-down-design-method-in-solidworks)

> One way is to have a master skeleton part  file which contains your layout sketches, and then mate things to that  when designing top down, and then have a configuration where those mates are suppressed. A rigid and flexible configuration of the subassembly.  Then just add the flexible one to the main assembly. Insert this part as the first feature in every component you create, and you can then use  its geometry directly to define parts too
